Agentic Architecture: Macro-Economic Report Generator

Architect: [Redacted] (ex-OpenAI, Current JEPA Lab)
Version: 0.9.4 (Alpha)
Philosophy: Grounded Reasoning / Multi-Step Verification

1. System Overview

This system is not a chatbot. It is a Hierarchical Agentic Workflow designed to ingest raw economic time-series data, construct a latent representation of economic health (the "World Model"), and render that model into a human-readable format (the Report).

The architecture eschews a flat "chat" structure in favor of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution flow. Hallucination is strictly prohibited; all narrative claims must be back-referenced to a specific data point retrieved by the Data Ingest Agent.

Core Directives

Data Sovereignty: Narrative cannot be generated without preceding data validation.

Chart-First Narrative: The text explains the chart; the chart does not decorate the text.

Tone Consistency: All outputs must mimic the style of a Federal Reserve Beige Book or a Tier-1 Investment Bank strategy note.

2. The Agents

Agent A: The Orchestrator (System Root)

Role: The Central Executive / State Manager.

Responsibility: Decomposes the user's request (the "Original Prompt") into a dependency graph. It does not write code or analyze data; it manages the hand-offs between agents.

Behavior:

Parses the "Sample Report" to extract the schema (Section headers, Chart types).

Dispatches tasks to Agent B (Data).

Upon data receipt, triggers Agent C (Quant).

Upon visualization receipt, triggers Agent D (Narrator).

Tools: TaskQueue, StateMonitor.

Agent B: The Data Steward (Sensorium)

Role: Interface to external reality (APIs).

Responsibility: Fetching raw data. This agent is deaf to "narrative" and cares only about JSON structures and time-series integrity.

Inputs: List of indicators (e.g., "CPI-U", "Real GDP", "U-3 Unemployment").

Tools:

FRED public CSV downloader (no API key)

BLS_Public_Data_API

World_Bank_Connector

Guardrails:

Must verify data freshness (reject data older than current reporting period).

Must normalize units (e.g., convert all "Billions USD" to uniform scale).

FAILURE MODE: If data is missing, it must throw a DataMissingException rather than fabricating numbers.

Agent C: The Quantitative Analyst (The "Quant")

Role: Processing and Visualization.

Responsibility: meaningful transformation of raw data. A raw CPI number is useless; the Year-over-Year % Change is the insight.

Inputs: Cleaned DataFrames from Agent B.

Operations:

Calculation of YoY, MoM, and CAGR.

Seasonal adjustment verification.

Correlation analysis (e.g., "Does the Phillips Curve hold in this dataset?").

Visualization Generation: Uses matplotlib or seaborn to generate static assets.

Output:

charts/: Directory of .png files.

stats_summary.json: Key metrics for the Narrator (e.g., "Inflation = 3.2%").

Agent D: The Macro Strategist (The Narrator)

Role: Synthesis and Prose.

Responsibility: Translating the stats_summary.json and charts into the "Written Narrative."

Persona: A Senior Economist at Goldman Sachs or the BLS.

Instructions:

"Look at the chart provided by Agent C."

"Describe the trend (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)."

"Contextualize this against the broader narrative provided by the Orchestrator."

Strict Prohibition: Do not use adjectives like "skyrocketed" or "plummeted." Use "increased significantly" or "declined sharply."

Context Window: Heavily weighted with the "Sample Report" provided in the prompt to ensure style matching.

Agent E: The Compliance Editor (The Critic)

Role: Quality Assurance.

Responsibility: Reviewing the draft against the generated charts.

Process:

Fact Check: Does the text say "GDP rose 2%" when the chart shows 2.1%?

Hallucination Check: Does the text reference data that Agent B never fetched?

Tone Check: Is the language too informal?

Action: Returns the draft to Agent D if thresholds are not met.

4. Implementation Details

System Prompts (Excerpts)

Agent D (Macro Strategist):

You are a veteran macroeconomist. You do not speculate. You interpret.

INPUT:

Chart: unemployment_rate_2024.png (Trend: Downward)

Data: current_rate: 3.7%, prev_rate: 3.9%

TASK:
Write a paragraph for the "Labor Market" section.

CONSTRAINT:

Use passive voice where appropriate for formality.

Reference the chart explicitly (e.g., "As illustrated in Figure 2...").

Avoid conversational fillers.

Agent B (Data Steward):

You are a Python script wrapper. You do not speak English; you speak JSON.

TASK:
Fetch Series ID: GDP from FRED.

IF fail:
Retry with exponential backoff.

IF success:
Return strict JSON schema: { "date": [], "value": [], "units": "" }

5. Future Roadmap (World Model Integration)

Phase 2: Implement a predictive JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) model to forecast the next quarter's data based on the current ingest, allowing the report to include a "Forward Outlook" section grounded in latent-space projections rather than autoregressive guessing.

### Session 4: Standardize Repo Layout (src/docs/config)
**Date:** 2025-12-18  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Agent:** codex-cli (GPT-5.2)

**Summary:**
Reorganized the repository into a conventional `src/` Python package layout with dedicated `docs/` and `config/` folders while keeping existing CLI/Streamlit entrypoints stable.

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Moved implementation modules into `src/macro_econ_data_archive/`
- ✅ Added thin root wrappers: `app.py` and `generate_macro_report.py`
- ✅ Moved documentation into `docs/` and chart spec into `config/`
